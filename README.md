- 👋 Hi, I’m @HopesFortune
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things
- 🌱 I’m currently learning really basic java.  I'm such a beginner it isn't even funny
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... well nothing, but I would love to just get to be a lurker in the background while others collaborate.  People who don't mind questions and teaching.
- 📫 How to reach me woods.alison@outlook.com
